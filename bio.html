	<h1 id="title">About Me</h1>
	<p id="content">I grew up in Camden, Maine in a half Russian, half American household. I was always interested in biology<br/>
		and history, and planned to become a doctor, like my eldest brother. However, upon arriving at Tufts, I almost<br/> 
		immediately found a new calling in computer science, and after	attending one intro biology lecture and one intro<br/>
		computer science lecture, I dropped bio and haven't looked back I haven't lost my love of history, hence my<br/>
		history computer science double majors; neither have I lost a love for the outdoors that I found growing up in rural<br/>
		Maine. I joined the Tufts Mountain Club as soon as I arrived at Tufts and was elected to my first of two terms on<br/>
		the TMC executive board during my first semester at Tufts. I also gained a love of public speaking during my<br/>
		employment as a lecturer at Hope Elephants. In order to continue with that passion I joined the TEDxTufts group as<br/>
		a speaker coach during my first semester at school. I firmly believe it's of the utmost importance that people<br/>
		have an understanding of both quantitative and qualitative disciplines, and I hope my choice of clubs and classes<br/>
		at Tufts illustrates that.
