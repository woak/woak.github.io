	<h1 id="title">About Me</h1>
	<p id="content">I grew up in Camden, Maine in a half Russian, half American household.</br>
		I was always interested in biology and history, and planned to become a doctor, like my eldest brother.</br>
		However, upon arriving at Tufts, I almost immediately found a new calling in computer science, and after</br>
		attending one intro biology lecture and one intro computer science lecture, I dropped bio and haven't looked back</br>
		I haven't lost my love of history, hence my history computer science double majors; neither have I lost a love for the</br>
		outdoors that I found growing up in rural Maine. I joined the Tufts Mountain Club as soon as I arrived at Tufts</br>
		and was elected to my first of two terms on the TMC executive board during my first semester at Tufts.</br>
		I also gained a love of public speaking during my employment as a lecturer at Hope Elephants. In order to continue</br>
		with that passion I joined the TEDxTufts group as a speaker coach during my first semester at school. I firmly believe</br>
		it's of the utmost importance that people have an understanding of both quantitative and qualitative disciplines, and</br>
		I hope my choice of clubs and classes at Tufts illustrates that.
